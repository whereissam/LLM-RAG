Top 10 must-do activities and top attractions in Germany:

1. Berlin Wall: No visit to the German capital is complete without seeing the Berlin Wall. This iconic wall, which divided Berlin during the Cold War, is now covered in colorful political murals. The East Side Gallery is the longest remaining section of the wall and also the world’s largest open-air gallery. You can also visit the remnants at the famous Checkpoint Charlie.
2. Beer Halls in Munich : Have you really been to Germany if you haven’t had a beer at a Munich beer hall? Munich offers over 4,000 beer brands, and locals are among the world’s top beer drinkers. Enter any nearby beer hall, and you may see men in traditional leather pants stumbling around, especially during Oktoberfest! If you're lucky, you might even catch them dancing. Grab a glass and get ready to say "Prost!" (Cheers)! For the full Munich experience, plan your trip from late September to early October to enjoy the world-renowned fall festival!
3. The Romantic Road : When it comes to classic German travel routes, the “Romantic Road” is a must. Drive along this 350-kilometer route and take in the scenic Bavarian mountain ranges and lush forests. You’ll pass through charming villages and rolling hills covered in forests. Along the way, stop to visit the majestic Harburg Castle with its orange roofs, and the medieval timbered houses of Rothenburg ob der Tauber.
4. Neuschwanstein Castle and Linderhof Palace : Nestled beneath the German Alps, Neuschwanstein Castle was the inspiration for Disney World’s castle in Florida. Linderhof Palace is another must-see royal residence, heavily influenced by the Romanesque style of France’s Versailles.
5. Cologne Cathedral : The majestic Gothic Cologne Cathedral towers over the city and is too tall to capture in a single smartphone shot. It was once the tallest building in the world from 1880 to 1890. If you plan to climb to the top, be ready for a workout! You'll ascend 533 steps to reach the UNESCO World Heritage site, where you can enjoy stunning views of the Rhine River cutting through the city.
6. Hamburg : Hamburg is not only Germany’s largest port but also one of the largest in the world. Stroll along the docks, check out the U-434 Russian submarine, and catch a glimpse of the Elbphilharmonie, a concert hall with a roof resembling cresting waves.
7. Walchensee Lake : Escape the hustle and bustle of Munich by visiting Bavaria’s crystal-clear lakes. The deep blue waters of Walchensee are so inviting you’ll want to jump in for a swim. You can also rent a paddleboat and explore the lake.
Klook tip: Bring hiking shoes and trek through the pine-covered Mittenwald hiking trails to experience stunning views of Walchensee. You’ll be captivated by its beauty. The lake is 1.5 hours by train from Munich. Grab your “3 to 15 Day German Rail Pass” from Klook and enjoy unlimited train rides through Europe’s best railway network.
8. Nuremberg Christmas Market : If you're in Germany in December, the enchanting Nuremberg Christmas Market is a must-visit, offering a full immersion into the festive atmosphere. Nuremberg’s main square is filled with over 180 stalls celebrating the season. Warm up with cinnamon-flavored mulled wine and delicious gingerbread (and of course, the popular hot German sausages!). You can also shop for unique handmade gifts, perfect for souvenirs.
Not visiting in December? You can always take a day trip to Nuremberg from Munich (about two hours by train) to explore this medieval town and learn about its rich history.
9. Berlin Reichstag : Berlin’s German Reichstag is one of the most visited parliament buildings in Europe. Why? The design is unique, with its glass dome shining in the sunlight. You can walk the spiral ramp up to the top for a 360-degree view of the city. Don’t forget to snap a selfie with the iconic dome!
10. Europa Park : Europa Park is so large that you could spend days exploring it! Enjoy thrilling roller coasters or admire miniatures of Europe’s most iconic sights. If rides aren’t your thing, relax with a boat tour, indulge in a spa, or treat yourself to a Michelin-starred dining experience.

Day 1: Explore Munich
I recommend starting your trip in Munich and using it as your homebase for the first three days or so of your trip. Munich has an international airport and a major train station that is super well connected to the rest of Germany (and other major cities in Europe)

You can see my full Munich Travel Guide here for details on getting there, where to stay, best things to do, best restaurants, best spots for drinks with views, and more.

Things to do in Munich Day 1:
Explore Old Town
Visit Marienplatz – the main square of Old Town and is one of the main areas you’ll want to spend time exploring in Munich. It’s also where you’ll see the infamous Rathaus-Glockenspiel (clock)
See Frauenkirche or the Church of Our Lady – The church known for its two unique shaped domes is located in the center of Old Town. You can admire from the outside or pay 7.50 Euro if you want to visit the inside.
Visit the Residenz Royal Palace & Odeonsplatz – Two other major landmarks located in the Old Town area are Residenz & Odeonsplatz
Grab a Beer at Hofbräuhaus
Hofbräuhaus is the iconic Beer Hall located right in the heart of Old Town. Grab a seat at one of the large communal tables, order a beer, make friends & enjoy the atmosphere.

Have Dinner at a Traditional Restaurant
Munich has tons of great dining options. Some of my top recommendations for a traditional meal would be:

Augustiner-Keller Biergarten
Steinheil
Salzkruste
Neuschwanstein Castle
Neuschwanstein Castle
Day 2: Day trip from Munich to Neuschwanstein Castle
Munich is a great location for taking day trips. One of my absolute favorites is Neuschwanstein Castle, the iconic castle that inspired Sleeping Beauty’s Disney castle. It’s a bit of a long day trip, so I recommend planning using most of your day to see it.

It takes over two hours each way to get to Neuschwanstein Castle, but it’s so worth it! Full details on a day trip to Neuschwanstein from Munich can be found here.

90 minute by car Alpseestrasse or 2 hours and ten minutes by train + bus (Train to Fussen,  73 or 78 bus to Alpseestrasse)
From Alpseestrasse 30 minute walk to castle or you can pay to take a carriage or shuttle (10 and 3 euro round trip, respectively)
Viewing from the outside is free and does not require a ticket
Tickets need to be purchased in advance online to go inside (I recommend skipping the inside, the outside is what you’re there for!)
concentration camp, dachau, memorial
Dachau Memorial
Day 3: Day Trip to Dachau Memorial & A Bike Tour of Munich
Day Trip to Dachau Memorial
Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site is a short day trip from Munich. It’s a powerful, impactful day trip. The sobering memorial is a stark reminder of the atrocities committed during the Holocaust. I recommend taking this day trip from Munich and dedicating about a half a day to it. Full details can be found here.

Dachau is reachable by train from Munich in 20 minutes
Admission to the Memorial Site is free of charge
Guided tours are available daily
Bike Tour of Munich & a Visit to Biergarten am Chinesischen Turm
Exploring Munich by bike is one of my favorite ways to see Munich! You’ll learn a lot about the Old Town, but also get to see a lot of the stunning English Gardens, the unique Munich river surfers and grab a stein at the infamous Biergarten am Chinesischen Turm in the English Gardens!

Ansbach Germany
Ansbach
Day 4: Stops in Nuremburg & Ansbach
For your last two days I recommend heading out of Munich and into the countryside. Rothenburg ob der Tauber is a great place to spend your last two nights, but on your way from Munich to Rothenburg there are a few great Bavaria spots to stop and explore.

To get to Rothenburg you can take the train through Nuremburg and Ansbach, which gives you the chance to visit both cities.

Nuremburg:
Can be reached directly by train via Munich
Nuremburg train station offers luggage storage which will allow you to leave your luggage and explore
See Nuremburg Castle
Visit Hauptmarkt
Ansbach
Ansbach is a small, charming Bavarian town that s a bit less touristy than Rothenburg and is a nice place to spend a few hours exploring

Can be reached directly by train via Nuremburg (and is a stop on the way to Rothenberg)
See the charming Old Town streets strung with colorful umbrellas
From Ansbach head to Rothenber ob der Tauber for the night, so you can have your entire 5th day to explore.

Rothenburg ob der Tauber
Rothenburg ob der Tauber
Day 5: Rothenburg ob der Tauber
Rothenburg ob der Tauber is one of my absolute favorite Bavarian towns. It’s straight out of a fairy-tale and is said to have inspired several Disney movies. It’s filled with colorful gingerbread houses & cobblestone streets encased by Medieval town walls.

Things to do in Rothenburg ob der Tauber
Wander the dreamy cobblestone streets of the Old Town
Climb and walk around the Medieval Wall that encase the city
Head outside the walls to get the best countryside view
Explore the quaint shops
Check out one of the infamous local pubs
Bavarian countryside
Bavarian Countryside
